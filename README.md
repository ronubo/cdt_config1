I am not responsible for anything in any way, and just used this as a place to upload files to support the tales of

Another example from another computer and another eclipse will follow - this one is actually slightly better on the particular 
Eclipse version, and since testing is a nightmare (can take hours), I just didn't do it on multiple platform
